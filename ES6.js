/* Promise:
A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion 
(or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
Promises provide a more powerful and flexible way to handle asynchronous operations compared to traditional callback functions.

Syntax : const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { });
*/

/* Complete a Promise with resolve and reject:
A promise has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
The promise you created in the last challenge is forever stuck in the pending state because you did not add a way to complete the promise. 
The resolve and reject parameters given to the promise argument are used to do this. 
resolve is used when you want your promise to succeed, and reject is used when you want it to fail. 
These are methods that take an argument, as seen below. */

  // responseFromServer represents a response from a server

    reject("Data not received");
  }

/* Handle a Fulfilled Promise with .then:
Promises are most useful when you have a process that takes an unknown amount of time in your code (i.e. something asynchronous), 
often a server request. When you make a server request it takes some amount of time, 
and after it completes you usually want to do something with the response from the server. 
This can be achieved by using the then method. 
Syntax:

myPromise.then(result => {
  
})

*/

  }

// If Successfull

  console.log(result)
});

// If Failed
makeRequest.catch(error => {
  console.log(error)
});



/* Handle a Rejected Promise with catch:
catch is the method used when your promise has been rejected. It is executed immediately after a promise's reject method is called.
Syntax: 

myPromise.catch(error => {
  console.log(error)
});
